# MAGIC #####Spark UI
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's review the executor and storage tabs in the Spark UI after the jobs completed. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Executor tab:
# MAGIC - Good for an overview of how much data is being transferred between stages (shuffle)
# MAGIC - Summary of memory currently used in executor
# MAGIC - Shows time spent GCing
# MAGIC

# MAGIC
# MAGIC #####Logs
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The spark UI is a great resource thanks to the visualizations, but the logs contain the finely grained details of how memory is being utilized.  We can see the exact values of what was processed and how, down to the individual bytes.
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC 17/06/14 08:56:28 INFO TaskMemoryManager: 624951296 bytes of memory are used for execution and 1391857080 bytes of memory are used for storage

# MAGIC
# MAGIC Tungsten is the in-memory storage format for Spark SQL / DataFrames. Advantages:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Compactness: Column values are encoded using custom encoders, not as JVM objects (as with RDDs). The benefit of using Spark 2.x's custom encoders is that you get almost the same compactness as Java serialization, but significantly faster encoding/decoding speeds. Also, for custom data types, it is possible to write custom encoders from scratch.
# MAGIC - Efficiency: Spark can operate directly out of Tungsten, without deserializing Tungsten data into JVM objects first. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's see an example of how Tungsten can impact the size of a cached dataset. 
# MAGIC

# MAGIC - When stored under Tungsten's format, the dataset takes up approximately 1/4 of the space compared to when it's stored as a Java object.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Considered an anti-pattern
# MAGIC - Default `cache()` = `persist(StorageLevel.MEMORY_AND_DISK_SER)` to avoid DF re-computation
# MAGIC - Better to read from DISK than to recompute
# MAGIC - With RDDs you could only alter a storage level once or an exception would be thrown
# MAGIC - With DFs, changing levels is fine. However, the change in storage will not overwrite the first value.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Data locality is how close data is to the code processing it. 
# MAGIC - If data and the code that needs to process it are close, physically, it will boost performance
# MAGIC
# MAGIC |   Locality Level |                                                                                             Description | Locality |
# MAGIC |------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
# MAGIC |    PROCESS_LOCAL | Data is in the same JVM as the running code. (best locality possible).                                  |  Highest |
# MAGIC |       NODE_LOCAL | Data is on the same node. Examples might be in HDFS on the same node, or in another executor on the same node. This is a little slower than PROCESS_LOCAL because the data has to travel between processes.||
# MAGIC |          NO_PREF | Data is accessed equally quickly from anywhere and has no locality preference. ||
# MAGIC |       RACK_LOCAL | Data is on the same rack of servers. Data is on a different server on the same rack so needs to be sent over the network, typically through a single switch. ||
# MAGIC |              ANY | Data is elsewhere on the network and not in the same rack. |   Lowest |
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Achieving locality
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Achieving locality isn't always possible. 
# MAGIC - Spark takes a best-effort approach using timeouts.
# MAGIC - If there is no **unprocessed data** on **idle executors** spark will aim for lower locality levels in order to better utilize available resources. There are 2 options for lowering task locality:
# MAGIC     - Wait for a busy CPU to free up where data is available for processing
# MAGIC     - Immediately start a new task on an executor without data, thus requiring data movement. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Spark waits for a busy CPU to free up. Once that timeout expires, Spark starts moving the data to the free CPU.  <br/>
# MAGIC You should **increase** these settings **if your tasks are long and see poor locality**, but the default usually works well.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC |                Property Name |            Default | Meaning |
# MAGIC |------------------------------|--------------------|---------|
# MAGIC |         `spark.locality.wait`|                 3s | How long to wait to launch a data-local task before giving up and launching it on a less-local node. The same wait will be used to step through multiple locality levels. `PROCESS_LOCAL` → `ANY`|
# MAGIC |    `spark.locality.wait.node`| spark.locality.wait| Customize the locality wait for node locality. For example, you can set this to 0 to skip node locality and search immediately for rack locality|
# MAGIC | `spark.locality.wait.process`| spark.locality.wait| Customize the locality wait for process locality. This affects tasks that attempt to access cached data in a particular executor process.|
# MAGIC |    `spark.locality.wait.rack`| spark.locality.wait| Customize the locality wait for rack locality.|

# MAGIC ##![Spark Logo Tiny](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/curriculum-release/images/105/logo_spark_tiny.png) GC tuning
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Picking a suitable garbage collector based on how spark is used plays a major part in performance. There are many choices and defaults can change depending on the environment used. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) Collectors
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) collector is designed for applications that prefer shorter garbage collection pauses and that can afford to share processor resources with the garbage collector while the application is running. Typically applications that have a relatively large set of long-lived data (a large tenured generation) and run on machines with two or more processors tend to benefit from the use of this collector. However, this collector should be considered for any application with a low pause time requirement. The CMS collector is enabled with the command-line option -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Similar to the other available collectors, the CMS collector is generational; thus both minor and major collections occur. The CMS collector attempts to reduce pause times due to major collections by using separate garbage collector threads to trace the reachable objects concurrently with the execution of the application threads. During each major collection cycle, the CMS collector pauses all the application threads for a brief period at the beginning of the collection and again toward the middle of the collection. The second pause tends to be the longer of the two pauses. Multiple threads are used to do the collection work during both pauses. The remainder of the collection (including most of the tracing of live objects and sweeping of unreachable objects is done with one or more garbage collector threads that run concurrently with the application. Minor collections can interleave with an ongoing major cycle, and are done in a manner similar to the parallel collector (in particular, the application threads are stopped during minor collections).
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Heap Space for Parallel and CMS
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The idea of the parallel and CMS GC algorithms is that they can carry out two types of garbage collection. A young generation GC and an old generation GC in an attempt to identify how long an object has been alive for. As the age of an object increases, it's likelihood to run through the check for garbage collection decreases. This is not to say that a very old object won't be collected if it's no longer referenced, it will just take the JVM longer to identify such an object for collection.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/curriculum-release/images/tuning/jvm-gc-overview.png" style="height:200px" alt="JVM Heap Space"/><br/>
# MAGIC - Newly allocated objects are placed in the Eden space
# MAGIC - Once the Eden space is full, this is likely to trigger a Young Gen garbage collection. 
# MAGIC - Any Eden objects that survive will be promoted to the survivor space.
# MAGIC - Objects in the survivor space are moved between S0 and S1 each time young gen GC runs, as they are copied they are also aged.
# MAGIC - Once survivor objects reach an aging threshold, they are promoted to the old gen space. 
# MAGIC - Old Gen contains objects that have survived several Young Gen GCs
# MAGIC - **Young Generation Garbage Collection** - Searches through the Eden and Survivor spaces, to GC objects that are no longer referenced. Any objects that remain as alive, can potentially be promoted to the old generation space. 
# MAGIC - **Old Generation Garbage Collection** - Searches through the Old Gen space to find objects that can be collected. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Parallel GC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In the Parallel GC algorithm garbage collection can use multiple threads to collect unreferenced objects. The Parallel GC algorithm prioritizes low pause times and is well suited to batch applications. Real-time applications would suffer greatly from this type of GC as it pauses application threads.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/curriculum-release/images/tuning/parallel.png" alt="Parallel GC"/><br/>    
# MAGIC - An algorithm that has stop-the-world garbage collection events. Both young and old GCs pause application threads. 
# MAGIC - Goals of Parallel GC are addressed in the following order:
# MAGIC     1. Maximum pause time goal - Application threads shouldn't be paused longer than `XX:MaxGCPauseMillis`
# MAGIC     2. Throughput goal - A ration of time spent running application threads to time spent garbage collecting. Specified via `XX:GCTimeRatio` setting. Default is 1/99 meaning 1% of total run time is spent in garbage collection.  
# MAGIC     3. Minimum footprint goal - Keep memory used by application as low as possible. 
# MAGIC     
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### CMS 
# MAGIC <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/curriculum-release/images/tuning/cms.png" alt="CMS GC"/><br/>    
# MAGIC - Uses multiple threads concurrently with application to scan for unreferenced objects
# MAGIC - CSM encounters Stop the world events in two scenarios:
# MAGIC     1. Initial mark - During the initial heap scan for root objects (objects in old gen that are reachable by threads entry points or static variables)
# MAGIC     2. Remark - When the application has changed heap state as CMS was running concurrently. CMS now has to go back and carry out a stop the world remark to verify it will collect the desired objects.
# MAGIC - CMS requires more CPU but allows the application threads more continuous execution time without pausing them
# MAGIC - Use cases are typically applications that can not afford to have large pause times.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### G1
# MAGIC <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/curriculum-release/images/tuning/g1-v2.png" alt="G1 GC"/><br/>
# MAGIC - Heap split into regions (typically 2MB, configurable via the `XX:G1HeapRegionSize` JVM flag.)
# MAGIC - GC Pauses become more predictable
# MAGIC - Regions assigned as Eden, Survivor, Old Gen or Humongous*
# MAGIC - Humongous regions are old gen regions, that are allocated contiguously by JVM. 
# MAGIC     - An allocation is considered "humongous" for objects larger than 50% of a region in G1.
# MAGIC     - These regions are used for large objects.
# MAGIC - In old gen GC, collecting regions with 0 live objects is easy
# MAGIC     - Rarely the case.
# MAGIC     - Old Gen GC works out *best regions* to GC.
# MAGIC     
# MAGIC #### G1 Considerations 
# MAGIC - Avoiding full GC - Full GC in G1 causes application threads to be paused so the garbage collecting algorithm can identify objects that are unreferenced and thus need to be garbage collected:
# MAGIC     1. We can reduce frequency of full GCs by reducing `InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent` which by default is configured to 45. Reducing this setting allows G1 to start initial concurrent marking at an earlier time. 
# MAGIC     2. Increasing `ConcGCThreads` will allow G1 to utilize more threads for concurrent marking. The tradeoff here is that this will take away CPU time from application threads and give them to GC. 
# MAGIC - Region size - G1 will decide region size depending on the heap size used. Region size can have significant performance implications as it dictates when an object is considered to be "humongous" and would require contiguous region allocation. Region size can be set via the `-XX: G1HeapRegionSize=<size>` JVM option.
# MAGIC - Avoiding Humongous allocation - Allocation of large objects takes longer than the regular process, especially with fragmented heaps. In Java 8u40 <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8027959" target = '_blank'>significant updates</a>
# MAGIC were added to optimize reclaiming heap space by GCing such objects, but overall collecting humongous objects is still relatively expensive.
